### What is this repo?

This repo, as a replacement to [ma-system-old] is a simplification, porting, and modernization of it

it effectively is:
- a full replacement of all legacy code with modern replacements, mainly architeched via rust with the use of v, nim and zig for some of the userspace designs
- a migration away from the old development ways
- a migration away from old versioning and management

this repo is currently made and maintained by [@awfixer] and the only approved AI models that can be used to help with the code are the [Anthropic] Models
